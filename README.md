# Graph-DFS

A Graph module that implements Depth First Search to perform an analysis of digraphs (identifies the number of links of each node in the graph, etc.). The program is written in C and uses the adjacency list implementation. The module, among other things, provides the capability of running Depth First Search and computing the transpose of a graph.
